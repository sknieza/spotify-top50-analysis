# Top 50 Spotify tracks analysis

In this notebook, we analyze top 50 Spotify tracks by performing initial data cleaning and preparation tasks, and looking for some insights across its features – artists, album count, track length, genres, also looking for correlations between features that describe the sound the tracks – acousticnesss, loudness, and alike. 

The dataset is located in `/datasets` folder. The Jupyter Notebook `spotify_top50_analysis.ipynb` is the working file of the analysis, which is structured as follows:

1. Context and task description;
2. Initial exploration and basic data cleaning;
3. Analysis of data question-by-question
4. Some key takeaways and further analysis suggestions in the end.

The analysis is performed using `pandas` library. See more in `requirements.txt`.
